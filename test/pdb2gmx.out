Processing chain 1 'A' (927 atoms, 61 residues)
Identified residue MET1 as a starting terminus.
Identified residue GLU61 as a ending terminus.
Checking for duplicate atoms....
Generating any missing hydrogen atoms and/or adding termini.
Now there are 61 residues with 927 atoms

Processing chain 2 'B' (2 atoms, 2 residues)
Warning: Starting residue NA1 in chain not identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.
Warning: Starting residue NA2 in chain not identified as Protein/RNA/DNA.
Problem with chain definition, or missing terminal residues.
This chain does not appear to contain a recognized chain molecule.
If this is incorrect, you can edit residuetypes.dat to modify the behavior.
Checking for duplicate atoms....

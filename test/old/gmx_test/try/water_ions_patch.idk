! The following section contains NBFixes for sodium interacting with
! carboxylate oxygens of various CHARMM force fields. It will generate
! level -1 warnings whenever any of these force fields have not been
! read prior to the current stream file. Since we don't want to force
! the user to always read all the force fields, we're suppressing the
! warnings. The only side effect is that you will have "most severe
! warning was at level 0" at the end of your output. Also note that
! the user is responsible for reading the current file last if they
! want the NBFixes to apply. A more elegant solution would require new
! features to be added to CHARMM.
! parallel fix, to avoid duplicated messages in the log
